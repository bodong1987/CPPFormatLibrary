This project has expired. If you are looking for a code library that supports the C# formatted string style and needs to support pre-C++11 standards, then this code library can continue to be used; if you are already using C++ 11 or newer standards, then you can refer to this repository:https://github.com/bodong1987/CppMiniToolkit  
This project contains a Format library rewritten using the C++11 standard, and uses features such as variable parameter templates to solve problems such as parameter limit limitations.
